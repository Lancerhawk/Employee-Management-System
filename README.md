# Employee Management System

A simple Employee Management System created with React, offering a login and dashboard experience for both employees and admins—all without a backend! This project demonstrates file system storage for managing user data locally and provides a clean, responsive interface for users to interact with tasks and deadlines.

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project started as an experiment to enhance my React skills while diving into the world of file system storage. With a growing interest in backend development and curiosity about file storage, I challenged myself to build an **Employee Management System**. Here, users can log in as either an employee or admin, access personalized dashboards, and manage tasks—all without relying on external databases.

### 🎯 Features

- **Local File System Storage**: Data is stored locally on the system, no backend required!
- **Admin Dashboard**: Admins can:
  - View a list of employees and their tasks
  - Assign new tasks to employees with an easy-to-use form
- **Employee Dashboard**: Employees can:
  - View, accept, and manage tasks
  - See deadlines with color-coded statuses for easy tracking
  - Manage tasks by setting deadlines, adding descriptions, and updating statuses (active, completed, etc.)
- **Responsive Design**: Fully responsive interface, except for the login page, which needs further optimization for mobile.

> **Note**: The login page currently experiences some lag on mobile devices due to the use of a 3D model. To improve performance, I may remove or simplify the 3D component in the future.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **React**: Frontend UI framework for building dynamic user interfaces
- **CSS**: For responsive styling and layout
- **Local Storage**: Simulates a database for managing login sessions and tasks

## 💡 Motivation and Learning Journey

After working with React for about four months, I wanted to:
- Deepen my knowledge in React and strengthen my frontend skills
- Experiment with file system storage, learning how to manage data without a backend
- Prepare for backend development and explore full-stack capabilities

## 🚧 Challenges and Future Enhancements

This project was built over two weeks (or one week if you skip my ideation phase!). Currently, I'm working on a new project featuring the complete **MERN** stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js) for **Zoblik Internationals**. Stay tuned for updates!
